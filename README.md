# Bankist-Array

Array Bankist is a JavaScript-based banking interface created to practice array methods, data transformations, event handling, and UI updates in real time. The project simulates a simplified online banking experience where users can log in, view their movements (deposits and withdrawals), transfer money, request loans, close accounts, and sort transactions. The main goal of the project is to deepen the understanding of important JavaScript concepts such as array manipulation (map, filter, reduce, find, sort), working with data structures, and updating the DOM efficiently. Every action—like transferring funds, loan approval, or account closure—updates the interface instantly, demonstrating how arrays can be used to manage real-time financial data. Bankist also includes formatted dates, summaries of deposits/withdrawals, interest calculations, balance updates, and auto logout functionality. The project is fully front-end based and does not use a backend or database; all data is stored temporarily in memory. It is built as part of modern JavaScript learning focusing on writing clean, interactive, and functional code.
